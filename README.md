List of python modules/custom=developed tools abstracting common processes for the OpenCV Library.
This started out as a way for newcomers/beginners to use OpenCV tools without the tediousness of extra parameters (ex. findContours() method).
I am also developing tools that can aid one in tuning such parameters (ex. easier HSV tuning with slidebars as opposed to re-running the program).
